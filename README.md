## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Tested with

- Java + [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html)
- [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)

### What I learned

In this project I used Automated testing techniques in order to make sure that some elements of the page are loaded correctly and in order to see that the API is working and sends the requested data and its displayed.

### Continued development

As usual the project is not finished and it could be improved to look like the design but my goal was to practive testing on a "real" project.
